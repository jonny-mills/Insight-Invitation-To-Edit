## Project Overview

Wikipedia serves more than 400M unique visitors per month. However, less than 1/10 of its editors are female, which in turn has created a biased resource.  One major reason often cited for causing women and other newcomers to be hesitant to become Wikipedia editors is the psychological barrier of not knowing where to start.  I address this issue by creating a pipeline to analyze the entire Wikipedia database with algorithms to suggest high impact, low barrier, and relevant-to-user Wikipedia pages to encourage new people to become first time editors.

## Solution strategy

Develop a pipeline that creates engaging invitations for first-time Wikipedia editors by identifying  edit opportunities that are low effort, high impact, and highly relevant to the userâ€™s interests.

## Calculating Category Impact Score

## Visualization Output

A) a dashboard where you can pick any category page and view it's "impact score" and possibly "conflict score" for editing (and all the the different components that go into the scores)
B) A dashboard that shows the top ten category pages that are low hanging fruit for first time editors: high impact, low conflict


## Twitter Bot Output
A daily automated email or tweet that shares three category pages each day that are low hanging fruit for first time editors to add to

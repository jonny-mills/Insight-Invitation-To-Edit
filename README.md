## Project Overview

Wikipedia serves more than 400M unique visitors per month. However, less than 1/10 of its editors are female, which in turn has created a biased resource.  One major reason often cited for causing women and other newcomers to be hesitant to become Wikipedia editors is the psychological barrier of not knowing where to start.  I address this issue by creating a pipeline to analyze the entire Wikipedia database with algorithms to suggest high impact, low barrier, and relevant-to-user Wikipedia pages to encourage new people to become first time editors.

Dashboard description: the user can pick a category page specific to their interests by selecting one of the icons located of the top of the dashboard.  By combining metrics across over 150 million rows: including clickthrough distribution, sum of pageviews, an overall impact score is created from the list of pages. Once a user finds a page that that they find interesting, or they are knowledgable about, they can click the page and be directed to the URL on Wikipedia to go ahead and edit. Note that only list pages are included on this dashboard with the reason being that according to research, lists are a great "low hanging fruit" opportunity for people to make their first Wikipedia edit.

## Twitter Bot Output
For users who want to constantly be notified about interesting list pages that they can go an edit, a Twitter bot was created that tweets out a new recommended list page to edit every 4 hours.  Each list page that is tweeted achieved an exceptional characteristic about it, being in the top 5% of one of the five metrics that were used to calculated impact score.  Check out the twitter bot here: twitter.com/WikiBot5
